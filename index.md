# Readme
### Aim
Make a snake game
### Objectives
- A very cool Background
- A snake that increases in length upon eating a grain of food
- Walls that if the snake touches them, it dies
- When the snake touches itself, it dies
- Scoring

### Additional Features:
- Levels with different wall structure
- There should be one level withouth walls such that the snake can go through left edge and come in through the right or vice versa
- Different tyes of food - power food that gives speed, special food that allows it to go through itself, big size?

# How to implement
1. Think of the logic
2. Write [Pseudocode](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-write-a-pseudo-code/)
3. Get reference from existing snake game on python and try to understand it
4. Make changes to your pseudocode if needed
5. Start coding


# Learning points
- Usage of git and github
- Programming logic and writing pseudocode
- Python coding
- Usage of external python libraries
- Much better experience and understanding of python

# Objectives(for coding)
- Creating the screen
- Create the background
- Create the snake(starts with 3 units of length)
- Make the snake move in an upwards direction so that if it goes through the top of the screen it comes back in from the bottom(and vice versa)
- Similarly, from left to right and vice versa
- Make the snake move based on the keyboard input
- Add tiny grains of food(1 unit each) randomly on the screen every 5 seconds
- Everytime the grain gets eaten it will disappear and randomly appear somewhere else
- When a grain of food is eaten, the snake will increase its length by 1
- If the snake touches itslef it dies
- If the snake dies, "game over" shows up
- Option to start again will appear
